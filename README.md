- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Yvonne
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m a seasoned GIS expert who loves to code.
- I am interested in using python programming to make sense of real world data that is often messy, needs cleaning and analysis in order to provide valuable insights.
- other than coding I love to build beautiful, insightful maps.
